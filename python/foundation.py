# For this assignment ensure you code using the best
# practices we have talked about. Do this cycle for each
# function you develop. Write the code in this module and
# create the appropriate test file.
# order:
# - write the stub
# - write the tests
# - run the tests (they must fail)
# - make them work
#

#
# All code must be in a function. Write all the code in this
# file and in the test code file. Create one function and several
# tests (in one method) to test the function.
#

#
# Write the code to prove to me you understand a function. Create
# your own function that has at least 5 lines in it. Create the tests
# to prove the function is doing what you expect.
#

#
# Write the code to prove you understand if statements and else
# statements. Make sure there are several statements in the if 
# and else. Write the code that proves to me you understand it.
